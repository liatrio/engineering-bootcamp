# 02 Questions Round 1 - System Thinking & Codebase Analysis

Please answer each question below (select one or more options, or add your own notes). Feel free to add additional context under any question.

## 1. Target Application for Analysis

What application(s) should students analyze to learn system thinking skills?

- [] (A) OpenTelemetry Demo Application - Use the OTel Demo App (polyglot microservices with full observability)
- [ ] (B) Custom example application - Create a new, smaller example specifically for this section
- [x] (C) Progressive approach - Start with a simpler custom example, then progress to OTel Demo
- [ ] (D) Students' own projects - Have students analyze their own or open-source projects
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## 2. Diagram Types and Depth

Which system diagrams should students learn to create?

- [ ] (A) Sequence diagrams - Focus primarily on sequence diagrams showing request/response flows
- [ ] (B) Component diagrams - Focus on component diagrams showing service boundaries and dependencies
- [ ] (C) Data flow diagrams - Focus on data flow diagrams showing information movement
- [x] (D) All three types - Teach sequence, component, and data flow diagrams
- [ ] (E) Other combination or different diagram types (describe)

## 3. Diagramming Tools

What tools should students use for creating diagrams?

- [ ] (A) PlantUML / Mermaid - Code-based diagramming tools (text-to-diagram)
- [ ] (B) Draw.io / Lucidchart - Visual diagramming tools (drag-and-drop)
- [x] (C) Student's choice - Allow students to use their preferred tool
- [ ] (D) Multiple tools - Introduce both code-based and visual tools, let students choose
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## 4. Scope of Transaction Tracing

How deep should transaction tracing exercises go?

- [ ] (A) Single service - Trace a request through one service (controller → business logic → data layer)
- [ ] (B) Two services - Trace a request across two communicating services (e.g., frontend → backend)
- [x] (C) Multi-service - Trace a request through 3-5 services in a microservice architecture
- [ ] (D) Full system - Trace a complex transaction through the entire system (database, cache, message queue, etc.)
- [ ] (E) Progressive complexity - Start simple, build up to multi-service tracing

## 5. Documentation and Communication Skills

What documentation skills should students demonstrate?

- [x] (A) Technical documentation - Write architectural decision records (ADRs) or technical specs
- [ ] (B) Code comments - Practice writing meaningful code comments and documentation strings
- [x] (C) README files - Create or improve README files explaining system architecture
- [ ] (D) Presentations - Prepare and deliver presentations explaining system architecture to team
- [ ] (E) Multiple formats - Practice multiple documentation formats (describe which)

## 6. Hands-On Exercise Structure

What should the main hands-on exercise involve?

- [ ] (A) Reverse engineering - Given a running application, students create diagrams and documentation
- [ ] (B) Diagram validation - Given diagrams, students validate them against actual code/behavior
- [ ] (C) Comparison exercise - Compare two different architectures for the same problem
- [x] (D) Progressive discovery - Start with partial information, students discover architecture through exploration
- [ ] (E) Other approach (describe)

## 7. Proof Artifacts

What should students produce to demonstrate their understanding?

- [ ] (A) Sequence diagram - A sequence diagram showing a specific transaction flow
- [ ] (B) Component diagram - A component diagram showing system structure
- [ ] (C) Written analysis - A document analyzing architecture decisions and trade-offs
- [x] (D) Presentation/walkthrough - A recorded or live walkthrough explaining the system
- [ ] (E) All of the above or other combination (describe)

## 8. Prerequisites and Student Background

What prior knowledge should students have before this section?

- [ ] (A) Just programming - Assume only basic programming knowledge (covered in earlier bootcamp)
- [ ] (B) Layered architecture - Students should have completed 11.0-11.2 (layers, design patterns, SOLID)
- [ ] (C) Docker/containers - Assume students can work with containerized applications
- [ ] (D) HTTP/APIs - Assume students understand HTTP requests, REST basics
- [x] (E) Multiple prerequisites - All of the above

## 9. Integration with Later Sections

How should this section prepare for later topics?

- [x] (A) Use same application throughout - Use one application (e.g., OTel Demo) for this section AND debugging/production sections (11.7-11.8)
- [ ] (B) Separate examples - Use different applications for analysis vs later production work
- [ ] (C) Build on examples - Start with simpler examples here, add complexity in later sections
- [ ] (D) Student's choice - Students can choose what application to work with in later sections
- [ ] (E) Other approach (describe)

## 10. Time Budget and Depth

How much time should students spend on this section?

- [ ] (A) Quick introduction (2-4 hours) - Brief overview of system thinking, simple diagram exercise
- [x] (B) Moderate coverage (4-8 hours) - Multiple diagram types, one substantial analysis exercise
- [ ] (C) Deep dive (8-16 hours) - Comprehensive coverage, multiple exercises, complex systems
- [ ] (D) Flexible depth - Provide core content plus optional advanced exercises
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)
